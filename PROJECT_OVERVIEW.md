# BloodLink: Smart Blood Donation & Emergency Matching Platform

## 🩸 Project Overview
**BloodLink** is a real-time, digital bridge between blood donors, hospitals, and recipients. Built to eliminate the critical delays in emergency blood procurement, the platform ensures that the right blood group reaches the right patient at the right time.

## ⚠️ The Problem
In medical emergencies, every second counts. Traditional blood donation systems often suffer from:
- **Communication Gaps:** Manual phone calls and uncoordinated social media posts to find donors.
- **Wasted Time:** Recipients contacting multiple hospitals and donors blindly.
- **Stock Inefficiency:** Hospitals struggling to broadcast urgent needs to specific matching donors.

---

## ✅ Our Solution
BloodLink digitizes the entire lifecycle of a blood request:
1. **Targeted Requests:** Users raise requests linked to specific hospitals and targeted to matching blood groups.
2. **Real-time Notifications:** Matching donors receive instant "Alerts" on their dashboard.
3. **Hospital Control:** A dedicated Hospital Dashboard to manage local blood stock, verify donors, and track emergency fulfillment.
