AI-READY, POINT-BY-POINT SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
Smart Blood Donation Platform (Web)
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a responsive web application that digitizes blood donation management by connecting individual users and hospitals through a single unified system.

The system must:

Use one common user account for both donors and receivers

Allow dynamic role switching based on user status

Provide real-time matching between blood requests and donors

Centralize hospital-level control and visibility

Store all data in a persistent database

2. USER ROLES & ACCESS CONTROL
2.1 Common User (Donor / Receiver)

A single registered user can act as:

Donor

Receiver

Or both (at different times)

Role is NOT fixed at registration.

Behavior is controlled using:

canDonate (boolean)

availabilityStatus (boolean)

activeRequest (object / null)

2.2 Hospital (Admin User)

Hospitals act as system supervisors.

Hospital users have permission to:

View all donors & receivers

Manage blood inventory

Create donor/receiver records

Monitor and validate donation flows

Handle emergency requests

3. AUTHENTICATION & REGISTRATION
3.1 Registration (Single Form for All Users)

Fields
